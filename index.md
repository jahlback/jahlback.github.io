I am a Social Science Research Fellow in the [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), part of the *Geldsetzer Lab*. I am also a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at [London School of Economy and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). 

My current research focus is on public health and the causal effect of vaccines on dementia. My other research interests include political and electoral behaviour in developing democracies. My research has been published in the British Journal of Political Science and the Journal of Development Economics.   

Before joining Stanford University, I was a post-doctoral fellow at LSE and at Royal Holloway University. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at LSE.
