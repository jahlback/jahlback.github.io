I am a Social Science Research Fellow in the [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), part of the *Geldsetzer Lab*. I am also a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at [London School of Economy and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). 

My current research focus is on public health and especially off-target effects of vaccines on dementia. My other research interests also include political and electoral behaviour in developing democracies.  

Before joining Stanford University, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science and at Royal Holloway University. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at London School of Economics and Political Science.
