I am a Social Science Research Fellow in the [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). As part of the *Geldsetzer Lab* I carry out causal analyses of electronic health records focusing on off-target effects of vaccines. My other research interests include political and electoral behaviour in developing democracies.  

Before joining Stanford University, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science and at Royal Holloway University. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at London School of Economics and Political Science.
