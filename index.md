I am a post-doctoral fellow in the [Department of Methodology](https://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). My research interests focus on elections, electoral integrity and voter behaviour in developing democracies, with a regional specialisation in Sub-Saharan Africa. I often rely on experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to study those topics. My work has been published in the Journal of Development Economics.

Before joining the Department of Methodology I worked as a teaching fellow at the Department of Politics and International Relations at Royal Holloway University. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at London School of Economics and Political Science.
